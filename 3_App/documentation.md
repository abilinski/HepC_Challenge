## Overview
 
<font size="3"> 
In 2019, about 58 million people were chronically infected with hepatitic C virus (HCV). Some experts have proposed challenge trials for HCV vaccine development. We modeled incremental infections averted through a challenge approach, under varying assumptions regarding trial duration, number of candidates, and vaccine uptake.  We computed the benefit-risk ratio (BRR) of incremental benefits to risks for challenge versus traditional approaches.  We also benchmarked against monetary costs of achieving incremental benefits through treatment. 
 
### About this model
This app implements a model for risks and benefits of challenge trials for HCV vaccine development. With considerable uncertainty around parameters, our objective is not to produce precise, definitive estimates.  Rather, we start from the premise that debates about HCV challenge trials invoke assumptions about the magnitude of risks and benefits, but that such assumptions are seldom explicit.  Through this exercise, we develop a framework that elucidates critical parameters affecting the magnitude of benefits and risks as well as key value judgments required for assessing challenge trials. The model is described in detail in THIS PAPER. 

### About the figures:
**Figure 1:**  
Figure 1 displays the incremental figure infections averted (discounted). The x-axis displays vaccine uptake and the y-axis displays future infections averted (millions, discounted to present value). We vary the number of vaccine candidates across columns and per trial success probability across rows.Colors correspond to the difference in length (years) between a traditional and challenge trial.  
  
**Figure 2:**  
Figure 2 displays the infection benefit-risk frontiers across different parameter values. Each line shows frontier for a given level of the infection benefit-risk ratio (BRR): expected incremental future infections averted by a challenge trial, discounted to present value (benefits) vs. incremental additional infections incurred by a challenge trial (risks). In other words, all points above a line have a BRR above that indicated by the line. We vary global vaccine uptake across the x-axis and the difference in trial length (years) between each traditional and challenge trial on the y-axis.The number of available vaccine candidates is varied across columns, and the per-trial success probability is varied across rows. QALY BRRs and sensitivity analyses are presented in the Supplement (Figures S4, S6-9).
